Erlang k-d trees
====
Implementation of k-d trees in Erlang

Introduction
------------

This implementation is based on the wikipedia page of k-d trees; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree
Dependencies are Erlang itself and proper (http://proper.softlab.ntua.gr/)

Caveats: Only tested with 2D coordinates. Unoptimised, much room for optimisation of the distance functions
and the current best updating functions for the nearest neighbour search.
